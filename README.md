# ABM – Adaptive Belt Monitoring  
### AI-Driven Digital Twin for Tension Stability and Motor Health

ABM (Adaptive Belt Monitoring) is an **AI-powered digital twin system** designed to monitor **belt tension stability and motor health** in industrial environments.  
The system combines **machine learning models**, **real-time inference**, and **MQTT-based streaming** to provide live diagnostics visualized through a **Unity dashboard**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Industrial belt-driven systems often suffer from hidden issues such as:
- Incorrect belt tension (loose / optimal / tight)
- Instability during operation
- Progressive motor health degradation

ABM addresses these challenges by:
- Analyzing vibration and energy-based features
- Classifying belt tension and stability in real time
- Streaming AI inference results to a digital twin dashboard
- Providing early warnings for unsafe or critical operating conditions

---

## 🧠 AI Models Used

The system uses **two machine learning models**:

### 1️⃣ Binary Stability Classification Model
- **Output:** Stable / Unstable
- **Purpose:** Detect operational instability in real time
- **Features:** Energy-based vibration metrics
- **Baseline tracking:** Drift detection for motor health

### 2️⃣ Multi-Class Tension Classification Model
- **Output:** Loose / Optimal / Tight
- **Purpose:** Identify belt tension condition
- **Features:** Extracted vibration features + scaling
- **Integration:** Combined with stability results for final health assessment

## ⚙️ Inference Engine & Streaming

- Implemented in **Python**
- Real-time inference pipeline
- MQTT-based communication
- Designed for **live integration with Unity**
- Supports scenario-based logic for machine state handling

Key components:
- `inference/` → Scenario handling & decision logic
- `mqtt/` → MQTT client & message publishing
- `models/` → Trained ML models & configurations
- `config/` → MQTT and system configuration files

## 🎮 Unity Digital Twin Integration

- Unity acts as the **HMI / dashboard**
- Receives AI inference results via **MQTT**
- Visualizes:
  - Belt tension state
  - Stability status
  - Motor health warnings
- Enables interactive monitoring in real time

> ⚠️ The Unity project is maintained separately and connected through MQTT topics defined in `unity_config.json`.
